        <p><font color=white size=5>A <a>black hole</a> is a region of spacetime exhibiting such strong gravitational effects that nothing-not even particles and electromagnetic radiation such as light-can escape from inside it. The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole. The boundary of the region from which no escape is possible is called <b ID=imp>the event horizon</b>. Although crossing the event horizon has enormous effect on the fate of the object crossing it, it appears to have no locally detectable features. In many ways a black hole acts like an ideal black body, as it reflects no light. Moreover, quantum field theory in curved spacetime predicts that event horizons emit <b ID=imp>Hawking radiation</b>, with the same spectrum as a black body of a temperature inversely proportional to its mass. This temperature is on the order of <b ID=imp>billionths of a kelvin</b> for black holes of <b ID=imp>stellar mass</b>, making it essentially impossible to observe.</font>
